# site_mac_xcode_1.html is just a learning exercise in web design and development for me. 
I hope to pursue the full development of my skills and learn about all the intricacies of web hosting in the process.
Once I have established a certain level of technical proficiency across many aspects of web design I will complete the 
official site for crowdsourcedevelopments. Please never hesitate to give me a shout here or to contribute to this experiment, 
I'd love to hear and learn from you.
Things I would like to explore include integration with SwiftUI, Python, Java Script, deployment of interactive 3d elements,
original CG and animations, Unreal Engine 5, Unity, game development, architecture and design and more.
